# The Reliability of Computational Replications

Part of the Crowdsourced Replication Initiative (Authors Omitted) investigating the reliability of research. Includes a direct replication of Brady and Finnigan ([2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122413513022)) undertaken by 85 independent research teams to verify their original numerical results testing the hypothesis that immigration undermines support for social policy in rich/Global North democracies. There was an experimental condition varying the transparency of the replication materials provided. 


## User Notes

The workflow is captured in the folder 'codes' with Rmd files that should be run in order starting with 00 through 02. These files have been run and knitted into html output which can be read in any browser. More information about the original data files are available in each code file. To see these open the [code](../code/) folder or follow the following links:

| File | Description |
| [00_Qualitative_Coding.Rmd](../code/00_Qualitative_Coding.html) | Extracts and counts qualitative categorizations of error by team |
| [01_Data_Prep.Rmd](../code/01_Data_Prep.html) | Prepares and combines participant survey results and replicated numerical effects by team |
| [02_Analysis.Rmd](../code/02_Analysis.html) | Correlations and regressions predicting our three reliability measures and two qualitative categories |
| [03_Figures.Rmd](../code/03_Figures.html) | Produces figures and additional tables |
